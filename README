= XML-MAPPING: XML-to-object (and back) mapper for Ruby

Xml-mapping is an easy to use, extensible library that allows you to
semi-automatically map Ruby objects to XML trees and vice versa. It is
easy to use and has a modular design that allows you to easily extend
its functionality.

== Example





=== semantics of attributes with/without default values:

- when initializing:

  - attributes with default values are set to their default values

  - attributes without default values are left unset


- when loading:

  - attributes without default values that are not represented in the
    XML raise an error

  - attributes with default values that are not represented in the XML
    are set to their default values

  - all other attributes are set to their respective values as present
    in the XML


- when saving:

  - unset attributes without default values raise an error

  - attributes with default values that are set to their default
    values are not saved

  - all other attributes are saved


This implies that:

- attributes that are set to their respective default values are not
  represented in the XML

- attributes without default values must be set explicitly before
  saving
