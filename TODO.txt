- write introductory text, including a small tutorial

- XML::XPath: generalize foo[@x='bar'] to foo[<any XPath
  expression>='bar'] (unless create/create_new implementation proves
  to be too difficult, but I don't think it will...)

- XML::XPath: write documentation

  - include design document there

- XML::Mapping: add XML::Mapping::xml_to_object(xml) (or similarly
  nemed): function that creates an object from an XML tree, where the
  object's class is deduced be 'un-dashing' the tree's root element
  name (i.e. reverse operation of default_root_element_name)

  - add to ObjectNode, ArrayNode, HashNode corresponding initializers
    which don't require a _klass_ argument

- XML::Mapping: Move @options hash functionality from
  SingleAttributeNode to Node.

- XML::Mapping: Additional node type "ProcNode" which is initialized
  with a "marshaller" and an "unmarshaller" procedure; they do the
  actual job. One could also think of optional :marshaller,
  :unmarshaller options for ObjectNode, ArrayNode, HashNode, (maybe
  others) which would, if given, replace the klass argument.

- XML::Mapping/default attribute values: Update documentation, digest
  "nil" issues...

- Rakefile/rdoc task: generate irb session log files & :include: them
  in the rdoc text(s). Pay attention to Windoze compatibility.
